Title:
  Automation Dev - Final Project

Demoblaze
General Instructions: 
•	Your assignment should be a Python program
•	Your assignment will use what we have learned so far (e.g. conditional statements, array, array built-in functions, and loop). 
•	You may also utilize the Internet as an extra source to help with your code. For example, you might need some useful built-in array functions, e.g. shuffle () if you use arrays to do this assignment. However, there are many correct ways to write a program.  All roads lead to Rome. 
•	No excuse for late work.  
•	All identical work will result in zero points for all parties involved. 
•	Your instructor can help with the explanation of this assignment but won’t help with debugging your code.
